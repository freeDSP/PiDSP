# Version B2

This version is functional with some minor modification. This is beta release, not a final version. Developement is underway to fix the bugs.
Due to BOM generation, schematics contains some parts that are not present on the pcb. Schematics and PCB are not synchronized. PCB is as it was at time of gerber generation. 

"Bugs highlight":
* DSP_Disable signal is not working - it will turn-off whole board
* Missing fixing pads for Tosling - you need to glue it
* jumper wire needed for one timing capacitors
